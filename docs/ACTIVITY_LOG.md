# KRTR Mesh Development Activity Log

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
KRTR Mesh is a peer-to-peer, encrypted messaging protocol designed for environments where traditional infrastructure has failed or is unsafe. Built for resilience, privacy, and simplicity, KRTR operates over local Bluetooth and WiFi radios with zero-knowledge proof capabilities.
