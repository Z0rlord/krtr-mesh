## ðŸ“Š **ZK Circuit Status**

All three Noir circuits are compiled and ready:

1. **âœ… Membership Circuit** (`circuits/membership/`)
   - Proves group membership anonymously
   - Tree depth: 20 levels
   - Status: Compiled and tested

2. **âœ… Reputation Circuit** (`circuits/reputation/`)
   - Proves reputation threshold privately
   - Supports complex reputation calculations
   - Status: Compiled and tested

3. **âœ… Message Proof Circuit** (`circuits/message_proof/`)
   - Proves message authenticity
   - Supports selective disclosure
   - Status: Compiled and tested

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Expo Go Times Out:**
1. Make sure you're connected to the same WiFi network
2. Try the direct link: `exp://u.expo.dev/aeeba0cd-2e0e-46aa-99c7-6e63472094b0`
3. Search for `@z0rlord/krtr-mesh` in Expo Go

### **If App Crashes:**
1. Check that your iPhone supports the required features:
   - iOS 11+ for Face ID integration
   - Bluetooth LE for mesh networking
   - Sufficient storage for ZK circuits

### **For Full iOS Features:**
- Wait for the development build to complete
- Install via TestFlight or direct install
- This gives you full Bluetooth mesh networking

## ðŸŽ‰ **Success Indicators**

When the app loads successfully, you should see:

1. **âœ… KRTR Mesh Logo** - App initialized
2. **âœ… "Initializing KRTR Mesh..."** - Services starting
3. **âœ… Main Interface** - Ready for testing
4. **âœ… ZK Services Active** - Zero-knowledge proofs ready

## ðŸ“ž **Next Steps**

1. **Test on iPhone** using Expo Go
2. **Try ZK features** - Generate and verify proofs
3. **Test with multiple devices** - Same QR code works on all devices
4. **Report any issues** - ZK functionality should work perfectly

Your KRTR mesh networking app with full zero-knowledge proof capabilities is ready for testing! ðŸš€
