❌ **App Launch Blocked**: "Unable to launch com.krtr.mesh because it has an invalid code signature, inadequate entitlements or its profile has not been explicitly trusted by the user"

**Root Cause**: Free Apple Developer account requires manual trust of developer profile on device

**Current Issue Status:**

- ✅ **SOLVED**: React Native 0.79.5 header file compilation issues
- ✅ **SOLVED**: react-native-sodium architecture mismatch (building for device works perfectly)
- ✅ **SOLVED**: iOS app build and compilation process
- 🔄 **Active Problem**: Developer profile trust required on iPhone for app launch
- 🎯 **Next Action**: Guide user through iPhone Settings to trust developer profile
- 📋 **Context Available**: Complete successful build process documented

#### 47. **User Prompt**: "we should be able to fix this in the phones settings"

**Solution Identified - iPhone Settings Fix:**

**Steps to Trust Developer Profile:**
1. iPhone Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
2. Find Apple ID/developer profile under "Developer App" section
3. Tap profile → "Trust [Apple ID]" → Confirm "Trust"
4. App should launch successfully after trust is established

**Updated Issue Status:**
